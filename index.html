    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Ashley and welcome to my website. I am a first year Information Technology (IT) student at RMIT and I graduated high school in 2015. I studied Engineering at Monash University for 2 years afterwards but did not find the course fulfilling and something I wanted to do in the future, so I stopped and went on to work full time for 3 years in hospitality. I’ve always had an interest in IT so in 2021 I decided that I would give myself another chance at university. My background is Chinese but have resided in Melbourne for all my life. In addition to speaking Mandarin and English, I also studied Japanese in high school and thoroughly studying languages so I’m also excited to learn the various languages in IT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of study my biggest hobby would be anything car related. I’ve always been a fan of cars starting from a young age with video games such as Need for Speed and in recent years I’ve enjoyed owning and modifying my own vehicles. I’m also a fan of motorsports, in particular formula 1. Being an Australian, I am a big fan of Daniel Ricciardo, especially during his days on Red Bull Racing. Even in motorsports and cars I find it very interesting that IT has become an integral part. Engine control unit (ECU) computing has become extremely important and in formula 1 entire teams are dedicated to collecting and interpreting telemetric data during a race.
    </p>
    <h3> Interest in IT </h3>
    <p>
      I started becoming interested in IT from my early teen years. I had always enjoyed and been intrigued by computers and innovations at the time such as the iPhone. One event was when I began learning about how to build a PC in 2010 and at the time there were a handful of Tech youtubers that made the information accessible and comprehensible even for a 12-year-old. I spent a lot of my spare time learning about how PCs worked and how each component would fit together as well as what purpose it served. My parents bought parts for me to build my own PC that year and It was an incredibly great learning experience and helped me get a deeper understanding and appreciation of PCs and IT.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience with IT is mainly limited to consumer related topics. I like to keep up to date with what trends and new products are emerging as well as what new technologies are being developed. This includes cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies which I believe to be highly innovative and has potential to be very relevant in the future. I have studied some IT subjects in past university experience and have some knowledge in JavaScript which has helped me with becoming orientated in some of the subjects so far this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve come to RMIT because of the great reputation that the University has. On top of being conveniently located I’ve heard that the IT faculty and facilities here are world class and very reputable. This is also supported by alumni of RMIT that I’ve spoken to who’ve enjoyed and found the program to be very helpful in their careers. Most importantly however, I believe that RMIT values a hands on and realistic approach to education which I find very beneficial and suits my learning style. It’s here at RMIT that I think I will be able to thrive and succeed in my studies and ultimately in the field of IT.
    </p>
    <p>In my time here at RMIT, I would like to learn the skills that will give me a solid foundation and the ability to operate in the field of IT. This would include the ability to program effectively by having a strong sense of fundamentals so that my knowledge can be effectively expanded in the future. I would also hope to learn as much as possible about working in the field so that I can understand what it is like to work as a team in the field of IT as well as, by the time I graduate, know which direction I would like to take in the field of IT. Most importantly however, I want to enjoy what I do while I am enthusiastic as a first-year student. Ultimately, I would like to develop a passion for the craft of programming and for IT.
    </p>
    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <img src="joblissting.png">
    <p>
      Bendigo Bank offers a position for an experienced Software Engineer. They are looking for someone to work on their Open Banking transformation project, specifically in their API and Microservices. The role also involves working with stakeholders and understanding customers to create a desirable product. The Job also requires work with an extensive network of partners which will help develop relationships within the industry. This listing interests me because It will be something beyond a graduate position that will be challenging in terms of expertise as well as being rewarding in that the product will be tangible in the real world. It will involve working in a team as well as collaboratively with other people which greatly interests me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skills required include an understanding of APIs and Microservices as well as being well versed in modern programming languages such as Python. Experience in AWS, Kubernetes and Docker are also desirable. Bendigo bank also requires extensive experience with CI/CD pipelines as well as a solid understanding of UNIX/Linux operating systems. The role also requires a strong level of communication such as experience working with Agile methodologies as well as technical leadership when communicating with technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the required skills, when compared with my skills, there are not many similarities. However, I have some experience with Python programming language as a part of Semester 1 studies at RMIT. The role requires communication and leadership skills of which I believe I possess partially due to my time in the workforce previously. I have also experienced various moments of leadership in high school, and I believe this would help in a position like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, I will need planning for the future in order to gain the skills required for a position such as this one at Bendigo Bank. I believe that being at RMIT University will aid with this as RMIT University will provide the education resources to be able to perform at a graduate level upon graduation. Additionally, I would need further personal development to also fit into a graduate role and any role beyond that scope. This includes general communication skills that would fit a professional environment as well as teamwork skills that would help top optimise the productivity of myself and others in a group project. While RMIT will provide resources to aid in this, looking externally to learn other programming languages and various IT skills will be very beneficial in broadening the range of skills I will have.

    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
    <p>
      For my personality tests I did the ’16 Personalities’ Myer-Briggs test, ‘Emtrain’ Study type test and the ‘Openpsychometrics’ Big 5 personality test.

    <h4>
      Top Factors
    </h4>
    <h5>
      Intellect/imagination (70th percentile)
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>This factor is often called Openness to Experience</li>
      <li>Tends to not be traditional and conventional</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>
      Extroversion (67th percentile)
    </h5>

      <li>Tends to be more outgoing and social</li>
    </ul>




    <p>
      I believe the results are somewhat indicative of my personality and I agree with the traits listed by the results. While some statements are very specifically targeted, I believe that these results provide a broad overview of my personality and behaviours. Even the traits that scored lower, such as Emotional stability in the ‘5 Big Personality’ test, should not be interpreted as not being present. Rather, these traits are not as present as main traits that scored higher, and the results serve as an indication that the lesser scoring traits need to be accounted for more consciously. The results of the study type test also suggest that by being a pragmatic, I prefer more visual and hands on learning to understand something and would rather attempt trial and error to see if something works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results suggest that I am an open-minded person who is open to new ideas as well as being a more extroverted individual as well as someone who prefers a hands-on approach to tasks. This would mean that in a team environment I would be someone that prefers to initiate conversation and put ideas forward. I would also be someone that would suggest trying something even if I am unsure if it will be guaranteed to work. As a result, I could provide good leadership and direction to be a voice for a group. However, the downside could be that I may disregard the ideas of others or overlook certain steps that require more thorough thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When forming a team, I believe that team members should balance their strengths and weaknesses with each other in order to also create a balanced and productive dynamic. Therefore, for someone like me who is explorative and experimental, it would be important to have a more logical and collected person to help with keeping the discussions in order and provide their logical explanations in discussing ideas. Also, being a pragmatic learner, having people that are good at giving visual explanations to things would be a welcome bonus as this would help me to understand things better.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Idea</h3>
    <h4>Motorstock</h4>
    <p>
      This project, titled Motorstock, will be a mobile app that allows users to track the history of used vehicle prices for any vehicle across many markets. The app will allow users to enter various parameters including vehicle make, model, odometer reading and more to get a current market value but to also observe the trend over time in the cars price. The focus of the app will be displaying trends in prices so there will be various trends and pieces of information available to see. The app will also be able to evaluate the entire used vehicle market and determine the overall value of the market over time. The app is aimed towards a variety of users such as those who are avid investors in the market, looking for the next car that will appreciate astronomically or on the other end, end users that simply want to track how well their car is holding its value.
    </p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>
      With the recent events of COVID-19, one of the somewhat unseen phenomena was the boom in used car prices, especially with used Japanese cars. Sports cars from the 1990s have skyrocketed in value in 2020 and the effect has been so significant it has inflated the entire market. To put things into perspective, ‘used-vehicle prices rose only 23 per cent from the depths of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis to the beginning of 2020’, says Moody’s analytics in a report from July 2020 but there has been a ‘30 per cent surge in prices since April ‘. While there are ways to observe used vehicle prices through various websites such as ‘Redbooks’, there is no concise, transparent and easily accessible source of information that is transparent to users. Motorstock aims to rectify this issue by delivering information to all people who are interested in this information.
    </p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      The goal of this app is to translate historical data and trends into graphs and to accessibly display them. For this, I believe a mobile app would be the best choice as smart phones are one of the most accessible pieces of computer hardware available. The interface will be simple and allow users to choose any make and model of car to see its available data. To start, the home screen will have a brief overview of the historical trend of any cars the user has saved, like that of a typical stock trading app as well as the historical trend of the overall car market. Any important news will also be displayed on the home screen for users to gather important information. This news information will be taken from various news sites that the Motorstock’s development team finds relevant and will be updated regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving on the app will have functionality to search for cars to search for in the market and after searching, the user will be taken to a new page that displaces all the information for that car. This will include the price trend of that car for various lengths of time as well as the volume that the car is being traded. The user will also be able to view previous completed listings of the car where available if they wish to find additional information. Current listings will also be available to see what is currently being offered as well as how saturated the market is at any time.  Various analysis tools will also be available that are based on mathematical analysis such as tools to measure expected growth or tools to measure the stability of a cars price.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various car markets in Australia as well as around the world so the price of a certain used car will vary from country to country. The app will use data from various sites for example, in Australia the main websites for car trading are Facebook marketplace and Carsales.com. Users may want to see specific data for their region so the app will be able to filter by whichever region the user chooses.
    </p>
    <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
    <p>
      In order to create this mobile app, development tools for either the Apple or Android platform would be required such as Apples Swift development tools or Android’s SDK. While swift is the programming language that apple uses, something like Javascript would also be required if developing the app for Android. A smartphone or an emulation run on a computer would also be required to test the software. Additionally, access to APIs for websites such as Facebook Marketplace and Carsales would be required to aggregate data for the Mobile app to interpret.
    </p>
    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
    <p>
      The most essential skills would be programming skills especially in programming for Mobile Apps. Programming skills in Swift or Javascript would be essential in creating mobile apps on Apple and Android platforms. Skills in databases would also be required as collating and accessing databases would be essential in interpreting the information that the app is required to display. A smartphone is also required to fully test the application in a real world setting and any computer could be used to program the apps code. All the skills and hardware required would be easily accessible given the popularity of mobile apps and the widespread acceptance of the mobile applications programming languages.
    </p>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>
      Should the project be successful, anybody will be able to access valuable information about the used car market. For a long time, investing in vehicles has been a difficult task that has been reserved for those most in tune with the market. With an app like Motorstock, the barrier for entry will be lower and with the aid of technology, even casual investors can try to turn a profit in the market of used cars. This app will change the way the used car market operates by introducing more users to the market and could potentially make the market less niche and more competitive.
